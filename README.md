# Weather-App#
## Description

I wanted to make a weather application that when inputting a city it provides you with the current date, temperature, wind, and humidity.  It also provides a 5 day forecast for the next few days in order to get an idea of what the coming week will be like. 
## Installation

Download the repo and install the files located at: https://github.com/Jp0st/Weather-App
OR
Access the page at : https://jp0st.github.io/Weather-App/ 
## Usage

The user types in the name of a city in the search bar at the top and the page is populated with the info about the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The user can then type in another city name to get a new set of results.  The previous searches are logged as buttons on the bottom of the page.  If the user wishes to return to a previous query they can click the button and the page will update providing the requested information.  When the search bar is left empty an alert will pop-up and prompt the user to please input a city into the field.
